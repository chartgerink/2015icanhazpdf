The original google sheet is publicly available at [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OXMHv6lal_GiMneW4xHa2wvG4BzTyD41zcCnmfF6PUY/edit?usp=sharing) page. The `data_extraction.R` file calls this sheet, automates some data cleaning, and saves it to the data folder for further analysis. This script is called from the analyses file, such that this does not have to be run independently.
